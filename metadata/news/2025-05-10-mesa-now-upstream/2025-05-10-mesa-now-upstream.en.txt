Now that the Asahi UAPI has been merged into the upstream kernel,
the Asahi and Honeykrisp OpenGL and Vulkan drivers are now enabled
in upstream Mesa as of 25.1.0.

As Honeykrisp is still a rather immature driver, we will continue
packaging our forked version to roll out important fixes faster
than the upstream Mesa release cadence can allow. However, it is
strongly advised that you unmask media-libs/mesa::gentoo to ensure
you always have the latest and greatest version, no matter where
it's coming from.

If you used the asahi-gentoosupport scripts to install, you can
unmask media-libs/mesa::gentoo by deleting the relevant line
in /etc/portage/package.mask/asahi. Once media-libs/mesa-25.1*
is unmasked in ::gentoo Portage will automatically offer it
to you, superseding the version currently packaged in the overlay.
