As of June, the Freedesktop Runtime for Flatpak has shipped with Mesa 25.1.
This negates the need to package a runtime extension, as the Asahi and
Honeykrisp GPU drivers for Apple Silicon are enabled upstream as of this
version.

As such, the Flatpak runtime extension for version 24.08 will be removed
from your system next time you update it. The extension for 23.08 will
continue to work until 23.08 reaches end of life next month. At that time,
the media-libs/mesa-asahi-flatpak package will be removed entirely.
